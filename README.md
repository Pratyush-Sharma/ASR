# Automatic Speech Recognition

-The data used is taken from VoxForge randomly .
-This is a python approach towards achieving speaker verification using GMM on UBM . 
-Using the UBM , the individual speaker models are created (here 2 speaker models are used).

-Then log likelihood is used over a random threshold to calculate 
 the final result to identify the whether the right person is speaking or not .  

-Alongside this a code is written to plot the required curves .
